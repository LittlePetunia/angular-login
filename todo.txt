basic auth working.

Next:

  [x] OAuth with google plus
      - prototype is working!!!

    todo:
      [x] create passport local strategy so code is consistent
      [] refactor code so config module is used.
      [] consider making modules for node areas: users:routes, model, controller.
          Not sure about this. I guess if you imagine a ton of routes, models, controllers
          yeah, you will want separate dirs for each.

      [] move the database config to config/mongo module

      [] refactor so routes/models are in same dir. So it looks like this:
        api
          user
            user.model
            user.data-access (later we will get rid of this and add these functions to the model)
            user.routes
            user.index (sets up routes)
        auth
          google
            routes
            passport
          local
            routes
            passport
          index
          service

      [] move DAL code to mongoose model






  [x] better error messages
    [x] return error id, msg for expected errors which we show message for
       other errors we give generic error message.


  [] create gulp tasks to run tests on test/build environments.
  [] can I just always build to dist in realtime and use for testing dev and pro?

  [] use less for css generation
    [] create gulp task to regenerate css on less file changes.
       This needs to happen when you are testing also so add this dependency to test tasks.

  [] refactor

    [] create notification directive that can be triggered from any other controller or service
       look at paul's toast project

        - [] add html feature
        - [] add header feature
        - [] add icon?

    [] create directive for login/logout/currentUser menu items

  [] create roles admin/user
  [] assign rights to roles {editSelf,editAll,readSelf,readAll}
     Read up more on typical role/permission models for web apps.

  [] main controller needs to watch AuthSvc.isLoggedIn so if a user logs out on one tab the change is noticed on second tab.



//create AuthService like so:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14206492/how-do-i-store-a-current-user-context-in-angular/14206567#comment20831205_14206567

app.factory( 'AuthService', function() {
  var currentUser;

  return {
    login: function() { ... },
    logout: function() { ... },
    isLoggedIn: function() { ... },
    currentUser: function() { return currentUser; }
    ...
  };
});


then controllers can use the service:
app.controller( 'MainCtrl', function( $scope, AuthService ) {
  $scope.$watch( AuthService.isLoggedIn, function ( isLoggedIn ) {
    $scope.isLoggedIn = isLoggedIn;
    $scope.currentUser = AuthService.currentUser();
  });
});


// what to store in token:
// issuer, expiration, scopes (what person can access, or maybe this could be roles), subject (user identifier)
 "iss": "http://galaxies.com",
  "exp": 1300819380,
  "scopes": ["explorer", "solar-harvester", "seller"],
  "sub": "tom@andromeda.com"
